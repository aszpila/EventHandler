This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>

## Installing and starting app

To be able to run client and server you should install all required dependencies mentioned in `package.json`.<br>
Open two terminals and go to the client and server folders by typing **cd client** and **cd server**.

Then use command: 

### `npm install`

in each terminal.

After installing you will be able to run each side of application.

To run the client side of the app you should go to the client folder (**cd client**) and run:

### `npm start`

That command runs the client side in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any errors in the console.


To run the server side of the app you should go to the server folder (**cd server**) and run:

### `npm run server`

That command runs the server side on the port 5000.<br>

## Running tests

To run tests go to the client folder (**cd client**) and run:

### `npm test -- --coverage`

The results will be presented in the console.<br>
